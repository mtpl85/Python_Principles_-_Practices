authority.\", \"[1] The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition,[2] though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes.\", \"[3] The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law.\", \"[2] One proposed definition is that a crime or offence (or criminal offence) is an act harmful not only to some individual but also to a community, society, or the state (\\\\\"a public wrong\\\\\").\", \"[5] What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country.\", \"While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.\", \"The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one\\'s liberty for committing a crime.\", \"Usually, to be classified as a crime, the \\\\\"act of doing something criminal\\\\\" (actus reus) must \\\\u2013 with certain exceptions \\\\u2013 be accompanied by the \\\\\"intention to do something criminal\\\\\" (mens rea).\", \"While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.\", \"The world of crime and criminals is often called \\\\\"the underworld.\", \"Governing or administering agencies may for example codify rules into laws, police citizens and visitors to ensure that they comply with those laws, and implement other policies and practices that legislators or administrators have prescribed with the aim of discouraging or preventing crime.\", \"In addition, authorities provide remedies and sanctions, and collectively these constitute a criminal justice system.\", \"Usually, a natural person perpetrates a crime, but legal persons may also commit crimes.\", \"Historically, several premodern societies believed that non-human animals were capable of committing crimes, and prosecuted and punished them accordingly.\", \"The sociologist Richard Quinney has written about the relationship between society and crime.\", \"When Quinney states \\\\\"crime is a social phenomenon\\\\\" he envisages both how individuals conceive crime and how populations perceive it, based on societal norms.\", \"The word crime is derived from the Latin root cern\\\\u014d, meaning \\\\\"I decide, I give judgment\\\\\".\", \"In 13th century English crime meant \\\\\"sinfulness\\\\\", according to the Online Etymology Dictionary.\", \"It was probably brought to England as Old French crimne (12th century form of Modern French crime), from Latin crimen (in the genitive case: criminis).\", \"In Latin, crimen could have signified any one of the following: \\\\\"charge, indictment, accusation; crime, fault, offense\\\\\".\", \"Crime wave is first attested in 1893 in American English.\", \"Whether a given act or omission constitutes a crime does not depend on the nature of that act or omission; it depends on the nature of the legal consequences that may follow it.\", \"[11] An act or omission is a crime if it is capable of being followed by what are called criminal proceedings.\", \"The expression \\\\\"crime\\\\\" means, in England and Ireland, any felony or the offence of uttering false or counterfeit coin, or of possessing counterfeit gold or silver coin, or the offence of obtaining goods or money by false pretences, or the offence of conspiracy to defraud, or any misdemeanour under the fifty-eighth section of the Larceny Act, 1861.\", \"For the purpose of section 243 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, a crime means an offence punishable on indictment, or an offence punishable on summary conviction, and for the commission of which the offender is liable under the statute making the offence punishable to be imprisoned either absolutely or at the discretion of the court as an alternative for some other punishment.\", \"A normative definition views crime as deviant behavior that violates prevailing norms \\\\u2013 cultural standards prescribing how humans ought to behave normally.\", \"This approach considers the complex realities surrounding the concept of crime and seeks to understand how changing social, political, psychological, and economic conditions may affect changing definitions of crime and the form of the legal, law-enforcement, and penal responses made by society.\", \"For example: as cultures change and the political environment shifts, societies may criminalise or decriminalise certain behaviours, which directly affects the statistical crime rates, influence the allocation of resources for the enforcement of laws, and (re-)influence the general public opinion.\", \"Similarly, changes in the collection and/or calculation of data on crime may affect the public perceptions of the extent of any given \\\\\"crime problem\\\\\".\", \"All such adjustments to crime statistics, allied with the experience of people in their everyday lives, shape attitudes on the extent to which the state should use law or social engineering to enforce or encourage any particular social norm.\", \"Behaviour can be controlled and influenced by a society in many ways without having to resort to the criminal justice system.\", \"Indeed, in those cases where no clear consensus exists on a given norm, the drafting of criminal law by the group in power to prohibit the behaviour of another group may seem to some observers an improper limitation of the second group\\'s freedom, and the ordinary members of society have less respect for the law or laws in general \\\\u2013 whether the authorities actually enforce the disputed law or not.\", \"Legislatures can pass laws (called mala prohibita) that define crimes against social norms.\", \"Other crimes, called mala in se, count as outlawed in almost all societies, (murder, theft and rape, for example).\", \"English criminal law and the related criminal law of Commonwealth countries can define offences that the courts alone have developed over the years, without any actual legislation: common law offences.\", \"One can view criminalization as a procedure deployed by society as a preemptive harm-reduction device, using the threat of punishment as a deterrent to anyone proposing to engage in the behavior causing harm.\", \"The state becomes involved because governing entities can become convinced that the costs of not criminalizing (through allowing the harms to continue unabated) outweigh the costs of criminalizing it (restricting individual liberty, for example, to minimize harm to others).\", \"The label of \\\\\"crime\\\\\" and the accompanying social stigma normally confine their scope to those activities seen as injurious to the general population or to the state, including some that cause serious loss or damage to individuals.\", \"Those who apply the labels of \\\\\"crime\\\\\" or \\\\\"criminal\\\\\" intend to assert the hegemony of a dominant population, or to reflect a consensus of condemnation for the identified behavior and to justify any punishments prescribed by the state (in the event that standard processing tries and convicts an accused person of a crime).\", \"More recent conceptions of the theory characterise crime as the violation of individual rights.\", \"Since society considers so many rights as natural (hence the term right) rather than man-made, what constitutes a crime also counts as natural, in contrast to laws (seen as man-made).\", \"Adam Smith illustrates this view, saying that a smuggler would be an excellent citizen, \\\\\"...had not the laws of his country made that a crime which nature never meant to be so.\\\\\"\", \"Natural-law theory therefore distinguishes between \\\\\"criminality\\\\\" (which derives from human nature) and \\\\\"illegality\\\\\" (which originates with the interests of those in power).\", \"They regard a \\\\\"crime malum in se\\\\\" as inherently criminal; whereas a \\\\\"crime malum prohibitum\\\\\" (the argument goes) counts as criminal only because the law has decreed it so.\", \"It follows from this view that one can perform an illegal act without committing a crime, while a criminal act could be perfectly legal.\", \"Some religious communities regard sin as a crime; some may even highlight the crime of sin very early in legendary or mythological accounts of origins \\\\u2013 note the tale of Adam and Eve and the theory of original sin.\", \"What one group considers a crime may cause or ignite war or conflict.\", \"Sir Henry Maine studied the ancient codes available in his day, and failed to find any criminal law in the \\\\\"modern\\\\\" sense of the word.\", \"[31] While modern systems distinguish between offences against the \\\\\"state\\\\\" or \\\\\"community\\\\\", and offences against the \\\\\"individual\\\\\", the so-called penal law of ancient communities did not deal with \\\\\"crimes\\\\\" (Latin: crimina), but with \\\\\"wrongs\\\\\" (Latin: delicta).\", \"Similarly, the consolidated Teutonic laws of the Germanic tribes,[35] included a complex system of monetary compensations for what courts would now[update] consider the complete[citation needed] range of criminal offences against the person, from murder down.\", \"[36] But only when a more centralized English monarchy emerged following the Norman invasion, and when the kings of England attempted to assert power over the land and its peoples, did the modern concept emerge, namely of a crime not only as an offence against the \\\\\"individual\\\\\", but also as a wrong against the \\\\\"state\\\\\".\", \"This idea came from common law, and the earliest conception of a criminal act involved events of such major significance that the \\\\\"state\\\\\" had to usurp the usual functions of the civil tribunals, and direct a special law or privilegium against the perpetrator.\", \"All the earliest English criminal trials involved wholly extraordinary and arbitrary courts without any settled law to apply, whereas the civil (delictual) law operated in a highly developed and consistent manner (except where a king wanted to raise money by selling a new form of writ).\", \"Thus criminal law grew out of what 21st-century lawyers would call torts; and, in real terms, many acts and omissions classified as crimes actually overlap with civil-law concepts.\", \"The development of sociological thought from the 19th century onwards prompted some fresh views on crime and criminality, and fostered the beginnings of criminology as a study of crime in society.\", \"Nietzsche noted a link between crime and creativity \\\\u2013 in The Birth of Tragedy he asserted:[needs context] \\\\\"The best and brightest that man can acquire he must obtain by crime\\\\\".\", \"In the 20th century, Michel Foucault in Discipline and Punish made a study of criminalization as a coercive method of state control.\", \"One can categorise crimes depending on the related punishment, with sentencing tariffs prescribed in line with the perceived seriousness of the offence.\", \"Thus fines and noncustodial sentences may address the crimes seen as least serious, with lengthy imprisonment or (in some jurisdictions) capital punishment reserved for the most serious.\", \"Under the common law of England, crimes were classified as either treason, felony or misdemeanour, with treason sometimes being included with the felonies.\", \"In common law countries, crimes may be categorised into common law offences and statutory offences.\", \"In the US, Australia and Canada (in particular), they are divided into federal crimes and under state crimes.\", \"In the United States since 1930, the FBI has tabulated Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) annually from crime data submitted by law enforcement agencies across the United States.\", \"They classify violations of laws based on common law as Part I (index) crimes in UCR data.\", \"These are further categorized as violent or property crimes.\", \"Part I violent crimes include murder and criminal homicide (voluntary manslaughter), forcible rape, aggravated assault, and robbery; while Part I property crimes include burglary, arson, larceny/theft, and motor-vehicle theft.\", \"All other crimes count come under Part II.\", \"For convenience, such lists usually include infractions although, in the U.S., they may come into the sphere not of the criminal law, but rather of the civil law.\", \"There are several national and International organizations offering studies

support.\", \"Emotional state (both chronic and current) have a tremendous impact on individual thought processes and, as a result, can be linked to criminal activities.\", \"Criminals who commit even the most horrendous of crimes, such as mass murders, did not see another solution.\", \"From the point of view of state-centric law, extraordinary procedures (international courts or national courts operating with universal jurisdiction) may prosecute such crimes.\", \"Note the role of the International Criminal Court at The Hague in the Netherlands.\", \"Activities sometimes criminalized on religious grounds include (for example) alcohol consumption (prohibition), abortion and stem-cell research.\", \"In various historical and present-day societies, institutionalized religions have established systems of earthly justice that punish crimes against the divine will and against specific devotional, organizational and other rules under specific codes, such as Roman Catholic canon law.\", \"In the military sphere, authorities can prosecute both regular crimes and specific acts (such as mutiny or desertion) under martial-law codes that either supplant or extend civil codes in times of (for example) war.\", \"Many constitutions contain provisions to curtail freedoms and criminalize otherwise tolerated behaviors under a state of emergency in the event of war, natural disaster or civil unrest.\", \"Two common types of employee crime exist: embezzlement and wage theft.\", \"The complexity and anonymity of computer systems may help criminal employees camouflage their

\"One can categorise crimes depending on the related punishment, with sentencing tariffs prescribed in line with the perceived seriousness of the offence.\", \"sentence_58\": \"Thus fines and noncustodial sentences may address the crimes seen as least serious, with lengthy imprisonment or (in some jurisdictions) capital punishment reserved for the most serious.\", \"sentence_59\": \"Under the common law of England, crimes were classified as either treason, felony or misdemeanour, with treason sometimes being included with the felonies.\", \"sentence_60\": \"In common law countries,

burglary, arson, larceny/theft, and motor-vehicle theft.\", \"sentence_66\": \"All other crimes count come under Part II.\", \"sentence_67\": \"For convenience, such lists usually include infractions although, in the U.S., they may come into the sphere not of the criminal law, but rather of the civil law.\", \"sentence_68\": \"There are several national and International organizations offering
